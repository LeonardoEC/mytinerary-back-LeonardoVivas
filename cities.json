Devastated during the Second World War and divided by the Wall for 28 years, Berlin recovers its former splendor with giant steps. The buildings of modern architecture erase with large brushstrokes the dark past of the city, creating a special atmosphere where the classic mixes with the modern and the extravagant with the everyday. The traces of the wall form the best of museums in which times of anguish due to division can be relived, the concentration camps expose their best kept secrets about the consequences of an exacerbated fascism and the bunkers transmit the terror that one day kept the city hidden by fear.",

And all this with the San Salvador volcano as a backdrop. The city is surrounded by slums as well as affluent suburbs with restaurants and large shopping malls. Peaceful settings, such as the Parque Cuscutlán botanical garden, provide a break from the hectic pace of the city.",
